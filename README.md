**GRID** (Generative Recommendation with Semantic IDs) is a state-of-the-art framework for generative recommendation systems using semantic IDs, developed by a group of scientists and engineers from [Snap Research](https://research.snap.com/team/user-modeling-and-personalization.html). This project implements novel approaches for learning semantic IDs from text embedding and generating recommendations through transformer-based generative models.

## 🚀 Overview

GRID facilitates generative recommendation three overarching steps:

- **Embedding Generation with LLMs**: Converting item text into embeddings using any LLMs available on Huggingface. 
- **Semantic ID Learning**: Converting item embedding into hierarchical semantic IDs using Residual Quantization techniques such as RQ-KMeans, RQ-VAE, RVQ. 
- **Generative Recommendations**: Using transformer architectures to generate recommendation sequences as semantic ID tokens. 


## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended)

### Setup Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/snap-research/GRID.git
cd GRID

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🎯 Quick Start

### 1. Data Preparation

Prepare your dataset in the expected format:
```
data/
├── train/       # training sequence of user history 
├── validation/  # validation sequence of user history 
├── test/        # testing sequence of user history 
└── items/       # text of all items in the dataset
```

We provide pre-processed Amazon data explored in the [P5 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13366) [4]. The data can be downloaded from this [google drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B5_q_MT3GYxmHLrMK0-lAqgpbAuikKEz/view?usp=sharing).

### 2. Embedding Generation with LLMs

Generate embeddings from LLMs, which later will be transformed into semantic IDs. 

```bash
python -m src.inference experiment=sem_embeds_inference_flat data_dir=data/amazon_data/beauty # avaiable data includes 'beauty', 'sports', and 'toys'
```

### 3. Train and Generate Semantic IDs

Learn semantic ID centroids for embeddings generated in step 2:

```bash
python -m src.train experiment=rkmeans_train_flat \
    data_dir=data/amazon_data/beauty \
    embedding_path=<output_path_from_step_2>/merged_predictions_tensor.pt \ # this can be found in the log dirs in step2
    embedding_dim=2048 \ # the model dimension of the LLMs you use in step 2. 2048 for flan-t5-xl as used in this example.
    num_hierarchies=3 \  # we train 3 codebooks
    codebook_width=256 \ # each codebook has 256 rows of centroids  
```

Generate SIDs:

```bash
python -m src.inference experiment=rkmeans_inference_flat \
    data_dir=data/amazon_data/beauty \
    embedding_path=<output_path_from_step_2>/merged_predictions_tensor.pt \ 
    embedding_dim=2048 \ 
    num_hierarchies=3 \  
    codebook_width=256 \ 
    ckpt_path=<the_checkpoint_you_just_get_above> # this can be found in the log dir for training SIDs
```


### 4. Train Generative Recommendation Model with Semantic IDs

Train the recommendation model using the learned semantic IDs:

```bash
python -m src.train experiment=tiger_train_flat \
    data_dir=data/amazon_data/beauty \ 
    semantic_id_path=<output_path_from_step_3>/pickle/merged_predictions_tensor.pt \
    num_hierarchies=4 # Please note that we add 1 for num_hierarchies because in the previous step we appended one additional digit to de-duplicate the semantic IDs we generate.
```

### 4. Generate Recommendations

Run inference to generate recommendations:

```bash
python -m src.inference experiment=tiger_inference_flat \
    data_dir=data/amazon_data/beauty \ 
    semantic_id_path=<output_path_from_step_3>/pickle/merged_predictions_tensor.pt \
    ckpt_path=<the_checkpoint_you_just_get_above> \ # this can be found in the log dir for training GR models
    num_hierarchies=4 \ # Please note that we add 1 for num_hierarchies because in the previous step we appended one additional digit to de-duplicate the semantic IDs we generate.
```
